# ZombieDuel
An iOS game where you duel zombies.

This is an Objective-C game that allows you to duel a zombie. You can choose one of 4 attacks to try and kill the zombie before it kills you. You progress to the next level by killing the zombie and can purchase upgrades to handle the zombies as they progressively get harder. You can choose your character and map.
